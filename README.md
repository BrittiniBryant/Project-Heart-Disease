# Project-Heart-Disease
Creating a model to predict whether someone has heart disease or not (based on the dataset provided).

Tools used:
  NumPy
  Pandas
  Matplotlib
  Seaborn
  
 Models Used:
  Logistic Regression
  KNeighbors Classifier
  Random Forest Classifier
  
 Model Evaluation Tools Used:
  train_test_split
  cross_val_score
  RandomizedSearchCV
  GridSearchCV
  confusion_matrix
  classification_report
  precision_score
  recall_score
  f1_score
  plot_roc_curve
  
 The dataset contains 303 rows. There were no missing values or NA values. 
 
 The Logistic Regression model performed the best out of all 3 models. Even with tuning, the other models held a lower accuracy score.
 
 The goal was to achieve a 95% accuracy score. Only 88% was reached. May need to continue experimenting. Perhaps with another model.
 May continue this project in the future...
